<h1> About me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Zaid!!! <br>
I'm a <b>Data Scientist</b> and <b>Game Developer</b>, love playing games, making games, doing math (ðŸ¤“), participating in events, and working on projects</p>

<h2>My Games</h2>
<p>Ive made a lot of games, mostly during Game Jams in teams, here are some of my favorite ones</p>

<h3>Bloxorz (Recreation)</h3>
<p>
	One of my first big solo projects, I had a blast recreating my childhood game in Unity.
	<br>
	I made 9 levels, also added my own moving platform mechanic 
	<br>
	I learnt alot, definitly need to re-remake it with better optimization and levels

<h3>Uprooted</h3>
<p>
	This was made on my 2nd game jam with my team
	<br>
	After our first game jam we learnt that we had to scale down by 10x ðŸ’€
	<br>
	So we made a simple but cute game where you play as a walking tree thats trying to reach his love, but you have to hide from people by turning into a normal tree
	<br>
	Although it was simple it was very polished and people loved it :)

<h3>Academic Weapon</h3>
<p>
	This was probably my 6th game jam, but what makes this one different is that we were very passionate about the game we were making, very FNAF inspired...also we got a mug!
	<br>
	You play as a student whos giving his final, but you didnt study for it so instead of facing the consqeuences of your actions you use your powers to make this disappear to cheat!
	<br>
	We were a team of just 3 competing against other teams that had <b>9</b> people!
	<br>
	Did I mention that we got a mug?
	<br>
	Definitly one of the biggest games I've worked on.

<h2>Big Projects</h2>
<p>Here are some other big projects Ive worked on</p>

<h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
<p>
	For a long time Ive tried to make an efficient Sudoku solver in Python, I tried avoiding using a brute force backtracking algorithm for a long time worrying about the speed and performance.
<br>
	After my C++ final exam, I immedietly went home and made a backtracking algorithm in C++ in a few hours and its <b>fast</b>
<br>
	You just simply enter the board data on a txt file and the program will read it, solve the board and display the results
<br>
	Im planning on making it automated to read a board directly from Sudoku.com and solving it automatically on the website. Just need to get good at web dev and web scraping
<br>
	Sudoku is also my least favorite game on Earth, I feel like a computer when trying to solve it which does not feel fun.

<h3>Batch File Renamer</h3>
<p>
	Back when I used to use a macbook, I noticed that it had a very neat feature where you can change the name of multiple files at once with some nice formatting options too
<br>
	I wanted to do the same on Windows, so I made one using python. Definitly proud of this one.
<br>
	Only issue was using tkinter, making GUIs is not fun...
</p>


<h3>This Website</h3>
<p>
	Definitly the hardest project Ive worked on, with 0 experience on HTML, CSS and JS, the amount of p and br are annoying
	<br>
	People always try to warn and scare me about JS but they dont know my main weakness is HTML ðŸ’€
	<br>
	Im currently learning HTML, I just finished the first module about headers, paragraphs and images (IMAGES COMING SOON)
