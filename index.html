		<h1> About me</h1>
		<p>Hi I'm Zaid!!! <br>
			I'm a <b>Data Scientist</b> and <b>Game Developer</b>, love playing games, making games, doing math (🤓), participating in events, and working on projects</p>

		<h2>My Games</h2>
		<p>I've made a lot of games, mostly during Game Jams in teams, here are some of my favorite ones</p>

		<h3>Bloxorz (Recreation)</h3>
		<p>
			One of my first big solo projects, I had a blast recreating my childhood game in Unity.
			<br>
			I made 9 levels, also added my own moving platform mechanic
			<br>
			I learnt a lot, definitely need to re-remake it with better optimization and levels

		<h3>Uprooted</h3>
		<p>
			This was made on my 2nd game jam with my team
			<br>
			After our first game jam we learnt that we had to scale down by 10x 💀
			<br>
			So we made a simple but cute game where you play as a walking tree thats trying to reach his love, but you have to hide from people by turning into a normal tree
			<br>
			Although it was simple it was very polished and people loved it :)

		<h3>Academic Weapon</h3>
		<p>
			This is probably my 6th game jam, we were a team of just 3 competing against other teams that had <b>9</b> people!
			<br>
			Did I mention that we got a mug?
			<br>
			Definitely one of the biggest games I've worked on.

		<h2>Big Projects</h2>
		<p>Here are some other big projects I've worked on</p>

		<h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
		<p>
			For a long time I've tried to make an efficient Sudoku solver in Python, I tried avoiding using a brute force backtracking algorithm for a long time worrying about the speed and performance.
			<br>
			After my C++ final exam, I immediately went home and made a backtracking algorithm in C++ in a few hours and its <b>fast</b>
			<br>
			You just simply enter the board data on a txt file and the program will read it, solve the board and display the results
			<br>
			Im planning on making it automated to read a board directly from Sudoku.com and solving it automatically on the website. Just need to get good at web dev and web scraping
			<br>
			Sudoku is also my least favorite game on Earth, I feel like a computer when trying to solve it which does not feel fun.

		<h3>Batch File Renamer</h3>
		<p>
			Back when I used to use a macbook, I noticed that it had a very neat feature where you can change the name of multiple files at once with some nice formatting options too
			<br>
			I wanted to do the same on Windows, so I made one using python. Definitely proud of this one.
			<br>
			Only issue was using tkinter, making GUIs is not fun...
		</p>

		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>
			Definitely the hardest project I've worked on, with 0 experience on HTML, CSS and JS, the amount of p and br are annoying
			<br>
			People always try to warn and scare me about JS but they don't know my main weakness is HTML 💀
			<br>
			I'm currently learning HTML, I just finished the first module about headers, paragraphs and images (IMAGES COMING SOON)
