    <h3>Udem Game Jam at Université de Montréal</h3>
    <img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIxMTIyNTA3LnBuZw==/original/B64VuK.png" alt="Academic Masters screenshot">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> <a href="https://shinykiwi.itch.io/academic-master" target="_blank">Academic Masters by The Fazbears</a></p>
    <p>This is my first game jam after graduating and we won! We had 24 hours to work on the theme related to "Teachers in Training".</p>
    <p>We decided to make a Plague Inc. inspired game where the teacher scores points from students, and uses it to upgrade the classroom and his teaching skills. The goal is to get all students in your class to pay attention and learn.</p>
    <p><strong>Teammates: </strong>Kira (Programmer), Nicolas (Programmer), Tuana (3D Artist)</p>

    <h3>ConUHacks IX at Concordia University</h3>
    <img src="https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/249/983/datas/gallery.jpg" alt="Finsurance screenshot">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/finsurance" target="_blank">Finsurance by HashBrowns</a></p>
    <p>We decided to do the Sun Life Insurance challenge where we built a website with an AI chat bot that helps you manage your finances and get financial advice.</p>
    <p>Our project, Finsurance won! It was a very challenging competition and I learnt a lot from it. This was my first exposure to PostgreSQL and web development as a whole.</p>

    <h3>McGame Jam at McGill University</h3>
    <img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzI0MDExNC8xOTM1MTIyMi5qcGc=/794x1000/%2F0Tdjg.jpg" alt="Reposession screenshot">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> <a href="https://zaidminhas.itch.io/reposession" target="_blank">Reposession by The Fazbears</a></p>
    <p>For this jam we made a simple Lost & Found game where the player has to return items based on an NPC’s request.</p>
    <p>Compared to jams before this, Reposession was our most complete and polished game. The judges tried their best to break our game but couldn’t :)</p>

    <h3>Gamerella at Concordia University</h3>
    <img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE4NzE1MDE1LmpwZw==/original/G98Baz.jpg" alt="Starlit Catch screenshot">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> <a href="https://tuanabicakci.itch.io/starlit-catch" target="_blank">Starlit Catch by The Fazbears</a></p>
    <p>By far one of the best experiences I have had at any event—there was a lot of food, so many nice people, great mentors.</p>
    <p>This was also by far the most beautiful game I had the luxury of working on. After spending way too long on vectors and boolean algebra, we made a fishing game inspired by the gameplay from RDR2 and named all the fishes after our teammates.</p>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 2024</p>
    <p>This was a very unique type of competition. Some challenges were fun but most were infuriating. However! Our team managed to be in the top 19 out of 120 teams!</p>
    <p>I had fun exploring new tools and websites to find the flag. I had a lot of fun reverse engineering some of the programs they gave us.</p>

    <h3>ConUHacks VIII</h3>
    <img src="https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/729/958/datas/gallery.jpg" alt="Tomster screenshot">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/tomster-project" target="_blank">Campfire Queue by Tomster</a></p>
    <p>My first Hackathon! We won the Behaviour Interactive sponsored challenge where we made a Queue Lobby for Dead by Daylight.</p>
    <p>Two of us worked on the math and the other two worked on the game simulation. We had the luxury of going to their office for a tour and won free Dead by Daylight Steam keys that I have yet to install.</p>
    <p>If I could pick any of these competitions to be my favorite, it would be this one. I had such a great time with my team, had fun at the Behaviour office tour, and it was the start of my competition spree.</p>
    <p><strong>Teammates: </strong>Sophia, Aidan, Hanae</p>
